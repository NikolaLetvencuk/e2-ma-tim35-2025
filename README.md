Every completed task fuels your progress. Defeating bosses represents overcoming daily challenges — as you level up, enemies become stronger, and victories more rewarding. Your dedication determines your hero’s power.

### 📋 Task Management
Organize your day efficiently. Create and categorize tasks, set priorities and difficulties, maintain streaks, and view everything in a clean calendar interface.

### ⚔️ Shop & Equipment
Spend your hard-earned coins on weapons, armor, and potions. Better gear means higher strength, greater rewards, and more impressive victories.

### 👥 Social Features
Connect with friends, form alliances, and take on group challenges. Share progress, chat with teammates, and grow together as a community of achievers.

### 📊 Progress & Stats
Track your growth through detailed charts and performance stats. Earn badges, monitor category-based productivity, and stay motivated by seeing your achievements visually.

### 🔔 Daily System
A smart daily reset system keeps you consistent — morning reminders, automated resets at midnight, and a seamless routine that helps you stay on track.
